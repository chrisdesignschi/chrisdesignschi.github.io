		<h1 style="font-family:Graphik Bold;">Long distance relationships are hard.</h1><br>
		<p>I made Love You Too for my friend Will. He works in Chicago while his girlfriend lives in Seoul, South Korea. That means that by the time he wakes up (8:30AM CST), his girlfriend is already asleep! (11:30 KST). I wanted to create an app that would solve the problem of long-distance couples having considerably less time in the day to exchange interactions and share intimacy with each other.<br><br>

		After several rounds of user testing with paper wireframes, I returned to the concept of the "love note". A time-tested concept for distance communication, from notes in empty champagne bottles to old-school snail mail, I created an app that mixed photography with user-creation and illustration to send unique notes.</p>

	<h1>Why drawings? They're fun.</h1><br>
	<p>During initial research I asked couples I knew to create messages for each other that could be photos/text/drawings—then, I asked them to "review" the romantic value of those mesages. As funny as that sounds, couples reported that a mix of media (photo paired with text, drawing on photo, etc) had the highest value. My qualitative take on this is that <b>creativity makes for good romance, and something accessible like simple drawings can bring out personality and add value to a text or photo.</b></p>

<h1>Extending Shared Time</h1><br>
	<p>Simply put, being in non-adjacent time zones means sharing less time in a day with your significant other. <br><br>Thus, the point of the app is to be able to schedule messages (like when you're asleep.) While Will prefers to call his girlfriend during the short time that they're both awake, it still feels nice to get messages from her throughout his day even while she's asleep.</p>

	<h1>Scheduling Between Time Zones</h1><br>
	<p>The time zone slider providers users with a way to see when their message will be sent to their partner. An advanced selection allows them to pick from presets and other options.</p>

	<h1>Image Wrapping</h1><br>
	<p>Further customizing and iterating on my schedule page, I added a feature that allows users to customize the aesthetic appearance of a notification that they send to a partner. Not only does this give the user more agency in creating their note, but also allows for a custom "unwrapping" experience for the person receiving.</p><br>

	<p>This is where my visual design took a departure from typical app aesthetics</p>
	</div>

	<div class="cont-para">
	<h1>Image Editing</h1><br>
	<p>In order to further support the use of overlaid drawings and text, I created a filter/gradient map feature that can be used to stylize any photo.</p><br>
	<p>Overall, I felt that a higher degree of image customization was necessary when relaying a sense of creativity to image creation by partners, allowing opening a notification and viewing a note to feel more like an "unwrapping" experience versus clicking something on an app.</p>

	<h1>Shared Canvas</h1><br>
	<p>Do you remember drawing cool pictures with your friends in elementary school? I implemented a "live canvas" as the home page for the app—this feature allows for both partners to draw on at the same time.

	<br><br>Over time, the drawings will fade. You can imagine one partner drawing something for the other to wake up—alongside the note aspect of the app, this allows for fun, collaborative interaction with your partner that isn't dependent on being in the same room.

	<h1>Thoughts & Learnings</h1><br>
	<p>This case study began as a lighthearted investigation on ways to make my friend Will's life better, and developed into something I believe has real potential. <b style="color:var(--accent-1">Building meaningful relationships is hard enough, without the strain added by imperfect long-distance or virtual communication.</b> As COVID has swept the global community this year, I've realized that these are problems no longer limited to long-distance international couples like Will and his girlfriend. We all can use a little more love and creativity in our lives.</p><br>

	<p>From a design and technical standpoint, I had to weigh a balance between creating something that encouraged creativity and intimacy, while also fostering a platform for repeat and smooth useage. I was heavily inspired by Google's Material Design as a framework for creating transparent and easily readable user experience cues.</p><br>
